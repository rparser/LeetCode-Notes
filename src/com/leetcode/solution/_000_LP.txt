二，Deep dive - Elastic search
English Version:
Background: During my tenure at eBay, I encountered a challenging situation within my team's Elasticsearch environment. The code for this segment had been written by a former employee who had left the company quite some time ago, leading to numerous issues. These issues included outdated data that couldn't be updated properly (resulting in errors during updates), the inability to validate data updates, confusion regarding the meanings and use cases of different indexes (creating chaos), occasional inability to connect to the correct Index, overlapping indexes across environments (DEV, QA, PREPROD, PROD), and version inconsistencies across different data centers, all of which affected the consistency.

Situation & Task: Facing these intricate challenges, I embraced the leadership principle of "Dive Deep." I recognized that resolving these issues required a comprehensive understanding of the existing codebase, Elasticsearch's core principles, and its APIs. My task was to find a solution that would streamline the entire process, ensuring data integrity and consistency across indexes while automating many manual steps.

Action: I began my initiative by thoroughly examining each aspect of the problem. I delved into Elasticsearch's documentation, whitepapers, and APIs to deeply understand its mechanisms and potential solutions. Recognizing the critical importance of the task, I meticulously crafted a plan to introduce an automated data ingestion (ingest) process. This process would also include thorough validation of indexes and the implementation of an automated alias update procedure to manage different indexes.

Additional Action: With my plan in place, I embarked on the implementation phase. I collaborated closely with my team members, sharing insights and gathering feedback to refine the proposed solutions. I carefully coded the automated processes, ensuring they were robust and reliable. I also conducted thorough testing, simulating various scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the new workflows.

Result: Upon completion of this project, the impact was substantial. The data ingestion process, which previously demanded over 24 hours of manual effort for each step, was now entirely automated, relying on scheduled batch jobs. This automation not only saved the team over a thousand hours in operation and maintenance but also ensured a high level of reliability in the data provided to over 140 million global users. The chaotic and inconsistent index situation was transformed into a streamlined, well-managed system that aligned with the principles of "Dive Deep" by addressing intricate details and enhancing overall efficiency.

背景：在我在eBay的任职期间，我遇到了团队Elasticsearch环境中的一项棘手情况。这部分代码是由一名离职多时的前员工编写的，导致了诸多问题。这些问题包括数据过时无法适当更新（导致更新时出错），数据更新无法验证，不同索引的含义和使用场景混乱，有时无法连接到正确的索引，不同环境（DEV、QA、PREPROD、PROD）中的索引交叉，不同数据中心的索引版本不一致，所有这些都影响了数据的一致性。

情境与任务：面对这些复杂的挑战，我秉持“深入挖掘”的领导原则。我意识到要解决这些问题，需要全面了解现有的代码库、Elasticsearch的核心原则以及其API。我的任务是找到一种解决方案，能够在自动化许多手动步骤的同时，简化整个流程，确保索引之间的数据完整性和一致性。

四，Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit：Neo4j的设计
Background: Upon joining eBay, I encountered a scenario that aligned with the principle of "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit." Our team was faced with the decision to transition to a new graph database, Neo4j, due to the growing size of our database. However, none of us in the team were familiar with this new database, prompting us to collectively enroll in a training course. The database was massive, with millions of nodes, and intricate communication with the Business team was essential. As a result, there were several contentious points in the database design process, particularly in defining relationships between nodes and categorizing various types of relationships.

Situation & Task: Throughout this complex database design process, my task was to uphold the principle of respectfully challenging decisions and fostering open discussions, even when there was disagreement. I recognized that while disagreements were natural, once a consensus was reached within the team, it was imperative to fully commit to the agreed-upon decision. My aim was to maintain a conviction-driven approach and avoid compromising for the sake of consensus.

Action: I actively participated in the discussions and debates surrounding the new database design, offering my perspective and raising questions whenever necessary. Even though I had differing opinions, I ensured that my stance was clear but respectful. I believed that an open exchange of ideas could lead to better solutions. To facilitate this, I proposed that we document all divergent opinions and ideas in a design document. This document served as a repository of discussions and decisions, capturing both the areas of agreement and disagreement.

Result: Despite the initial disagreements, the commitment to the decisions made within the team was unwavering. While it was uncomfortable and sometimes exhausting to challenge and discuss, we collectively embraced the principle of "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit." Over the course of several months, the ongoing discussions and debates led to a more refined database design. In the end, the project was a success, and the new database was successfully implemented with over five million data points. Moreover, this collaborative process resulted in the development of new services that extended user engagement on the platform by more than 15%, showcasing the positive impact of embracing disagreements and committing to decisions with backbone.

背景：加入eBay后，我遇到了一个与“坚持原则；不同意并全力支持”原则相关的情境。我们团队面临着一个决策，即由于数据库规模不断增大，我们需要转向使用新的图数据库Neo4j。然而，我们团队中没有人熟悉这个新数据库，因此我们一起报名参加了培训课程。这个数据库非常庞大，有数百万个节点，并需要与业务团队进行复杂的沟通。由此，在数据库设计过程中出现了许多争议。例如，如何定义节点之间的关系，以及如何对各种关系进行分类等。

情境与任务：在这个复杂的数据库设计过程中，我的任务是坚守尊重挑战决策并促进开放讨论的原则，即使存在分歧。我意识到，虽然存在分歧是自然的，但一旦团队内达成共识，就必须全力以赴地执行所达成的决策。我的目标是保持一个有信念的方法，避免为了达成共识而做出妥协。

行动：我积极参与了关于新数据库设计的讨论和辩论，随时提出我的观点和问题。即使我有不同意见，我也确保自己的立场明确且尊重。我认为，开放的思想交流可以引导我们找到更好的解决方案。为了促进这一点，我建议我们将所有不同意见和想法记录在设计文档中。这个文档成为了讨论和决策的存储库，记录了共识和分歧的领域。

结果：尽管最初存在分歧，但团队内对决策的承诺是坚定的。尽管挑战和讨论可能会令人感到不适和疲惫，但我们共同践行了“坚持原则；不同意并全力支持”的原则。在几个月的时间里，持续的讨论和辩论导致数据库设计变得更加完善。最终，这个项目取得了成功，新数据库成功实施，拥有超过五百万个数据点。此外，这个协作过程还带来了新服务的开发，将平台上用户的参与度延长了超过15%，展示了接受分歧并全力支持决策的原则带来的积极影响。
